However, it can be dissolved in some organic solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and diglyme. These solvents have a high polarity and a relatively low boiling point, which allows them to dissolve lithium salts and other compounds containing lithium. Other solvents that can dissolve lithium include acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and water. It should be noted that the solubility of lithium in these solvents depends on various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other compounds.\""
